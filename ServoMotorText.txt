What is a Servo Motor? 
A servo-motor is an electrical device which can push or rotate an object with great precision. If you want to rotate and object at some specific angles or distance, then you use servo motor. It is just made up of simple motor which run through servo mechanism.
If motor is used is DC powered then it is called DC servo motor, and if it is AC powered motor then it is called AC servo motor. We can get a very high torque servo motor in a small and light weight packages. Doe to these features they are being used in many applications like toy car, RC helicopters and planes, Robotics, Machine etc. Servo motors are rated in kg/cm (kilogram per centimeter) most hobby servo motors are rated at 3 kg/cm or 6 kg/cm or 12 kg/cm. This kg/cm tells you how much weight your servo motor can lift at a particular distance.
For example: A 6 kg/cm Servo motor should be able to lift 6 kg if the load is suspended 1cm away from the motors shaft, the greater the distance the lesser the weight carrying capacity. The position of a servo motor is decided by electrical pulse and its circuitry is placed beside the motor.
